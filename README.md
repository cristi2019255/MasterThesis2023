# MasterThesis2023

This is the code repository for master thesis of Grosu Cristian for 2023 at Utrecht University

## Usage guide

Run the following command to install the needed dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run the following command to start the application `python3 main.py`

## Tasks to be done

### 1) Refactor the DBM code

Maybe start another branch for that DEV-2
First merge DEV-1 to main and then git checkout -b DEV-2

### 2) Integrate DBM with the GUI

Still the coloring and the training and testing data embadings have to be returned

### 3) Think about a way of how to upload the data to the GUI faster

This is not really an issue

### 4) Build the error images for the DBM such as (confidence of classifier, dbm errors (see the paper sent in email), projection errors) and include them into the GUI

...

### 5) Make a search in all the TODOs and do the fixes
